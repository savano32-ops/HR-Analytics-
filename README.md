KEY FINDINGS FROM POWER BI DASHBOARD

  1.Attrition Rate:

        The dataset includes both current employees and ex-employees, with a noticeable attrition rate. Key departments affected include Sales and R&D.

         Employees in the age group of 25-34 and 35-44 show higher attrition rates.

2.Department Analysis:

     Sales: Higher attrition, especially among Sales Representatives and Sales Executives.

.

 3.Job Role Impact:

    Roles with high attrition: Sales Representatives, Laboratory Technicians, and Research Scientists.

    Roles with low attrition: Managers, Healthcare Representatives, and Manufacturing Directors.

 4.Employee Demographics:

    Gender: Attrition is observed across both genders, but no significant disparity is evident.

    Marital Status: Single employees show slightly higher attrition compared to married or divorced employees.

    Age: Younger employees (25-34) and mid-career employees (35-44) are more likely to leave.

  5.Work-Related Factors:

     Business Travel: Employees who travel frequently (Travel_Frequently) show higher attrition.

     Overtime: Employees working overtime (Yes) are more likely to leave.

  6.Job Satisfaction: Lower job satisfaction scores correlate with higher attrition.

  7.Work-Life Balance: Poor work-life balance is linked to higher attrition.

  8.Compensation and Benefits:

     Employees with lower monthly incomes or those who feel underpaid are more likely to leave.

     Stock option levels and salary hikes do not seem to significantly impact attrition.

 9.Tenure and Promotions:

    Employees with fewer years at the company or in their current role are more likely to leave.

    Lack of promotions (Years Since Last Promotion) is a contributing factor to attrition.


RECOMMENDED HR ACTIONS

 2.Improve Work-Life Balance:

 3.Enhance Job Satisfaction:

 5.Promotion and Growth Opportunities:

 6.Exit Interviews:  

 CONCLUSION.

 The HR data highlights critical areas where employee retention can be improved, particularly in Sales and R&D departments. Addressing work-life balance, job satisfaction, and career growth opportunities will be key to reducing attrition. By implementing targeted initiatives, the organization can create a more supportive and engaging workplace, ultimately retaining top talent and reducing turnover costs.
